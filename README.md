Phyzmo is an all-in-one solution for data collection and visualization in mechanics labs. The Phyzmo iOS app allow users to record footage of moving objects in labs (ie. a ball rolling down a ramp) and uses computer vision to precisely track these objectsâ€™ positions over time. Graphs are automatically generated using the data, including displacement over time, velocity over time, and acceleration over time. Raw data and graphs are available for easy upload into Microsoft Excel, Google Spreadsheets, and many other apps. We believe that allowing students to conveniently collect and view data through their phones enhances their learning efficiency.
